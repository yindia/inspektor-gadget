description: 'Trace HTTP and HTTPS traffic'
---

The trace_http gadget monitors HTTP and HTTPS traffic at the application layer, capturing requests and responses along with their metadata.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ sudo ig run trace_http [flags]
```

## Description

This gadget traces HTTP/HTTPS traffic by intercepting TCP send and receive operations. It provides visibility into:

- HTTP request methods and paths
- Response status codes
- Request/response latency
- Host headers and user agents
- Protocol detection (HTTP vs HTTPS)

The gadget uses eBPF to hook into kernel functions, allowing it to capture traffic without modifying applications or using proxies.

## Flags

- `--capture-request`: Enable capturing HTTP requests (default: `true`)
- `--capture-response`: Enable capturing HTTP responses (default: `true`)
- `--max-body-size`: Maximum body size to capture in bytes, 0 = disabled (default: `0`)
- `--min-latency`: Minimum latency in milliseconds to report (default: `0`)

## Output Columns

- `TIMESTAMP`: Event timestamp
- `COMM`: Process name
- `PID`: Process ID
- `SRC`: Source IP address and port
- `DST`: Destination IP address and port
- `PROTO`: Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)
- `METHOD`: HTTP method (for requests)
- `HOST`: Host header value
- `PATH`: Request path
- `STATUS`: HTTP response status code
- `LATENCY`: Request latency in milliseconds

## Examples

### Monitor all HTTP traffic

```bash
$ sudo ig run trace_http
TIMESTAMP                           COMM         PID      SRC                  DST                  PROTO METHOD HOST                PATH              STATUS LATENCY
2024-01-15T10:23:45.123456789Z     curl         12345    192.168.1.10:54321  93.184.216.34:80    HTTP  GET    example.com         /               200    45
2024-01-15T10:23:46.234567890Z     wget         12346    192.168.1.10:54322  93.184.216.34:443   HTTPS GET    example.com         /index.html     200    120
```

### Monitor slow requests only

```bash
$ sudo ig run trace_http --min-latency=500
```

This will only show requests that took more than 500ms to complete.

### Monitor requests to specific container

```bash
$ sudo ig run trace_http -c my-container
```

## Use Cases

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track slow HTTP requests and identify bottlenecks
2. **Security Auditing**: Monitor unexpected HTTP traffic or connections
3. **Debugging**: Trace HTTP interactions without modifying application code
4. **Service Mesh Observability**: Understand service-to-service communication

## Limitations

- HTTPS traffic content is encrypted; only metadata is visible
- HTTP/2 multiplexing may affect request/response correlation
- Very short-lived connections might be missed
- Body content is not captured by default for performance reasons
